//Part 3
/*Part 3: Create logic that iterates through all three teams of players and generates a personalized letter to the guardians, letting them know which team their child has been placed on and when they should attend their first team team practice. As long as you provide the necessary information (player name, team name, guardiansâ€™ names, practice date/time), feel free to have fun with the content of the letter. The team practice dates/times are as follows: Dragons - March 17, 1pm, Sharks - March 17, 3pm, Raptors - March 18, 1pm
 
 When your complete code is run in a playground the letters should be visible in the right hand pane. If the code is run within an actual Xcode Project, the letters should be visible in the console.*/
